# jQuery Bootstrap Touch Keyboard (jQBTK)

This jQuery plugin using Bootstrap v3 to generate a popover keyboard for use on touchscreen devices. It was originally designed for use on large touchscreen computers used in a kiosk scenario, but would probably work elsewhere too.

It uses the Bootstrap popover component and dynamically adds buttons to form a keyboard, inserting the characters into the HTML input when pressed.

It requires jQuery and Bootstrap v3.

# Installation

1. Add Bootstrap CSS
2. Add `jqbtk.min.css`
3. Add jQuery
4. Add Bootstrap JS
5. Add `jqbtk.min.js`

# How to use

Refer to the [documentation.html](documentation.html) file for examples on usage. Or go to [www.matthewdawkins.co.uk/jqbtk](http://www.matthewdawkins.co.uk/jqbtk/) for documentation and working examples.

Note: since the keyboard listens for touch events, using this in a browser and clicking your mouse probably won't work in the first place. However, there are some options:

 - Chrome's Developer Tools has a "device mode" that emulates touch events.

 - In standard Chrome, you can enable the touch UI: Go to `chrome://flags`, search for "touch", and enable the appropriate settings.
